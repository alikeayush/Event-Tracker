# Event Planner

Event Planner is a simple web application that allows users to plan and organize events. This project was created as part of a learning journey to practice front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By building this application, I aimed to gain hands-on experience in DOM manipulation, user interface design, and data management in the browser.

## Features

- Add new events with a name, date, and description.
- View existing events with details.
- Delete events individually.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (including Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript

## Project Overview

This project served as a practical exercise to reinforce my understanding of front-end web development concepts. Through building the Event Planner application, I learned:

- How to structure and organize HTML to create a user interface.
- CSS styling techniques to enhance the visual appeal of the application and ensure responsiveness across different devices.
- JavaScript programming for implementing interactivity, such as event handling and dynamic content updates.
- Utilizing localStorage for data persistence in web applications without a backend server.
